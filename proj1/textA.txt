the fulton county grand jury said friday an investigation of atlantas recent primary election produced no evidence that any irregularities took place the jury further said in term end presentments that the city executive committee which had over all charge of the election deserves the praise and thanks of the city of atlanta for the manner in which the election was conducted the september october term jury had been charged by fulton superior court judge durwood pye to investigate reports of possible irregularities in the hard fought primary which was won by mayor nominate ivan allen only a relative handful of such reports was received the jury said considering the widespread interest in the election the number of voters and the size of this city the jury said it did find that many of georgias registration and election laws are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous it recommended that fulton legislators act to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them the grand jury commented on a number of other topics among them the atlanta and fulton county purchasing departments which it said are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments merger however the jury said it believes these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration the city purchasing department the jury said is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies it urged that the city take steps to remedy this problem implementation of georgias automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury it urged that the next legislature provide enabling funds and re set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected the grand jury took a swipe at the state welfare departments handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes this is one of the major items in the fulton county general assistance program the jury said but the state welfare department has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all counties in the state with the exception of fulton county which receives none of this money the jurors said they realize a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties nevertheless we feel that in the future fulton county should receive some portion of these available funds the jurors said failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden on fulton taxpayers the jury also commented on the fulton ordinarys court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation wards the jury said it found the court has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations of two previous grand juries the atlanta bar association and an interim citizens committee these actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the courts wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms the jury said regarding atlantas new multi million dollar airport the jury recommended that when the new management takes charge jan the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences the jury did not elaborate but it added that there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable ask jail on other matters the jury recommended that four additional deputies be employed at the fulton county jail and a doctor medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail fulton legislators work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable pension plan for city employes the jury

tuesday night in blue ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience state party chairman james w dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held sept in savannah at which newly elected texas sen john tower will be the featured speaker in the blue ridge meeting the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters despite the warning there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate according to republicans who attended when the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race it voted no and there were no dissents the largest hurdle the republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race one of two alternative courses must be taken five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the

daniel personally led the fight for the measure which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous legislatures in a public hearing before the house committee on revenue and taxation under committee rules it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week but questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it daniel termed extremely conservative his estimate that it would produce million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next aug he told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books since texas was a republic it permits the state to take over bank accounts stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more the bill which daniel said he drafted personally would force banks insurance firms pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer the escheat law can not be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property daniel declared dewey lawrence a tyler

of bank customers if you destroy confidence in banks you do something to the economy he said you take out of circulation many millions of dollars rep charles e hughes of sherman sponsor of the bill said a failure to enact it would amount to making a gift out of the taxpayers pockets to banks insurance and pipeline companies his contention was denied by several bankers including scott hudson of sherman gaynor b jones of houston jb brady of harlingen and howard cox of austin cox argued that the bill is probably unconstitutional since he said it would impair contracts he also complained that

texas house of representatives was an effort by big cities like dallas and fort worth to cover up places like paradise a wise county hamlet of people when the shouting ended the bill passed to sending it to the senate where a similar proposal is being sponsored by sen george parkhouse of dallas most of the fire was directed by cotten against dallas and sen parkhouse the bill would increase from to the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project cotten construed this as a veiled effort by parkhouse to help dallas and other large cities get money which cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural texas statements by other legislators that dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending

was told in criminal court yesterday the disclosure by charles bellows chief defense counsel startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial bellows made the disclosure when he asked judge parsons to grant his client alan clements a separate trial bellows made the request while the all woman jury was out of the courtroom fears prejudicial the statements may be highly prejudicial to my client bellows told the court some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property it is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others judge parsons leaned over the bench and inquired you mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this yes your honor replied bellows what this amounts to if true is that there will be a free for all fight in this case there is a conflict among the defendants washington july president kennedy today pushed aside other white house business to devote all his time and attention to working on the berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the american people over nationwide television and radio the president spent much of the week end at his summer home on cape cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of white house aids in washington with whom he talked by telephone shortly after the chief executive returned to washington in midmorning from hyannis port mass a white house spokesman said the address text still had quite a way to go toward completion decisions are asked to elaborate pierre salinger white house press secretary replied i would say its got to go thru several more drafts salinger said the work president kennedy advisers and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest berlin crisis precipitated by russias demands and proposals for the city the last cases in the investigation of the nov election were dismissed yesterday by acting judge john m karns who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence by unfair and fundamentally illegal means karns said that the cases involved a matter of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence of the persons he said evidence was obtained in violation of the legal rights of citizens karns ruling pertained to eight of the cases in the two other cases he ruled that the state had been unable to make a case contempt proceedings originally had been brought against persons in precincts by morris j wexler special prosecutor issue jury wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about persons involved in the election investigation questioned the individuals in the criminal courts building but did not take them before the grand jury mayer goldberg attorney for election judges in the precinct of the ward argued this procedure constituted intimidation wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning karns said it was a wrongful act for wexler to take statements privately and outside of the grand jury room he said this constituted a very serious misuse of the criminal court processes actually the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the criminal court of cook county altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court said karns who is a city judge in east st louis sitting in cook county court faced seven karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving persons wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with complementary miscount of the vote in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another the cases involved judges in the and precincts of the ward the and precincts of the ward the precinct of the ward and the precinct of the ward the case of the judges in the precinct of the ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by karns two other cases also were under advisement claims precedent after reading his statement discharging the ward case karns told wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed he would dismiss them washington feb president kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on million american workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of million americans over who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs the president in a special message to congress tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships build new medical and new dental schools and expand child health care and general medical research the aged care plan similar to one the president sponsored last year as a senator

taxes the social security payroll tax is now per cent per cent on each worker and employer on the first of pay per year the kennedy plan alone would boost the base to a year and the payroll tax to per cent per cent each similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system the payroll tax would actually rise to per cent starting jan if the plan is approved because the levy is already scheduled to go up by per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs outlays would officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run billion or more in the first year both figures would go higher in later years other parts of the kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of million to billion dollars over the next years these would be paid for out of general not payroll taxes nursing home the aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems full payment of hospital bills for stays up to days for each illness except that the patient would pay a day of the cost for the first
