To run the code without heldout data `python3 project2_template.py` 
To run the code with heldout data for validation `python3 project2_template.py split`

The plot for training data likelihood without heldout data is at `log_likelihood.pdf`
The predictions and the confidence scores for each dev instance is at `result.txt`

For the contrastive system that uses an held out part for validation:
The plot is at `log_likelihood_with_heldout.pdf`
The predictions and the confidence scores for each dev instance is at `result_split.txt`
